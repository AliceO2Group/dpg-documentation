# Regular reports

Regular reports shall be given by the respective Service Work Student, if available, during the [Asynchronus QC Meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/category/8532/).
These reports shall be prepared if found necessary by the DPG or AsyncQC conveners or otherwise on a - tentatively - bi-weekly basis.

Such a report should focus on reporting issues, if any, such as

* some comparisons have changed significantly compared to previous comparisons,
* some new histograms are seen to be introduced,
* histograms are seen to have been taken out,
* etc.

The report is meant to provide a brief overview, so should not be longer than 10-15 min.
If decided or necessary, a JIRA ticket needs to be created. For this, one can adapt the approach described [here](official_requests.md).

MC data for the comparison can be retrieved from the anchored nightlies running on the GRID, either for [pp](https://alimonitor.cern.ch/job_events.jsp?timesel=0&owner=aliprod&filter_run=536683:536683&filter_jobtype=pp%2C+13.6+TeV+-+Nightly+anchored+production+to+pp+data+periods+in+LHC23%2C+O2-4628) or [PbPb](https://alimonitor.cern.ch/job_events.jsp?timesel=0&owner=aliprod&filter_run=544122:544122&filter_jobtype=Pb-Pb%2C+5.36+TeV+-+Nightly+anchored+production+to+Pb-Pb+data+periods+in+LHC23%2C+O2-4628).
