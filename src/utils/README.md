# Utilities

The documentation is [here](../../docs/software/doc/expert.md).

## ToDos

These are explicit items that should be implemented

* in the logs, add a short description of what is done instead of having all git output chained together -> better readability
* add operators to the doc summary
* add date and time per tag and label in the doc summary
* add a (hidden) directory for better internal bookkeeping to not spam the user's working directory
